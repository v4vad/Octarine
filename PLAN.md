# Octarine Roadmap & Specification

**Status:** Core functionality complete. Plugin is fully functional.

**Historical Reference:** See [docs/COMPLETED.md](docs/COMPLETED.md) for completed phases and refactoring details.

## Active Roadmap

### Performance Improvements

**Tier 1 — High-impact, user-visible**
- [ ] Cache OKLCH gradient picker output; redraw only when hue changes (avoids ~40k culori conversions per drag tick) — `components/color-picker/GradientPicker.tsx`
- [ ] Restore gamut lookup table — replaces ~25 culori binary searches per stop with O(1) lookup — `lib/gamut-utils.ts`, new `lib/gamut-table.ts`
- [ ] `React.memo` heavy panels and stabilize callbacks via `useReducer` so a slider tick doesn't re-render the whole tree — `App.tsx`, `components/`
- [ ] Wrap palette regeneration in `useTransition` so slider drags stay at 60fps — `App.tsx`, `components/colors/ColorRow.tsx`
- [ ] Minify build output and audit culori tree-shaking; replace blocked Google Fonts `@import` with embedded `@font-face` — `build.js`
- [ ] Batch Figma variable export (hoist `getLocalVariablesAsync` out of per-stop loop) — `platform/figma/figma-utils.ts`

**Tier 2 — Medium-impact**
- [ ] Faster duplicate detection (Set-based lookup instead of array scanning)
- [ ] Smarter contrast refinement (adaptive step sizing, early exit)
- [ ] Skip unnecessary color conversions (direct OKLCH contrast calculation)
- [ ] Cache parsed `bgOklch` across one palette gen — `lib/contrast-utils.ts`, `lib/color-distinctness.ts`
- [ ] Memoize `getMaxLightnessForMinChroma` (pure function of `hue`, `minChroma`) — `lib/gamut-utils.ts`
- [ ] Hoist hue-only invariants (HK `hueFactor`, BB `maxShift`) out of the per-stop loop — `lib/perceptual-corrections.ts`
- [ ] Eliminate `{ ...color }` allocations in tight loops — `lib/contrast-utils.ts`, `lib/perceptual-corrections.ts`, `lib/artistic-curves.ts`
- [ ] Throttle `Slider.tsx` `onChange` to `requestAnimationFrame` — `components/primitives/Slider.tsx`
- [ ] Stabilize `GradientPicker` mousemove handler so the listener isn't re-bound every render — `components/color-picker/GradientPicker.tsx`

**Tier 3 — Polish & scale**
- [ ] Delta-based undo history (replace 50 full-state snapshots with action/inverse pairs) — `lib/useHistory.ts`
- [ ] Diff state on `saveState` (partial snapshots after first save) — `platform/figma/adapter.ts`, `App.tsx`
- [ ] Hydrate before first paint (kill default-state flash on plugin open) — `App.tsx`, `platform/figma/code.ts`
- [ ] Web stub: idle-time `localStorage` writes or IndexedDB migration — `platform/web/adapter.ts`

> Tier classification and file references derive from a 2026-04-26 audit. See the brainstorm at `~/.claude/plans/we-wrote-down-a-sunny-sonnet.md` for evidence and per-item implementation sketches.

### Polish & Quality
- [ ] Import/export JSON
- [x] Error handling improvements (toast notifications, input validation feedback, helpful Figma error messages)

### UI Improvements
- [ ] Better onboarding & empty state (welcome message, quick-start presets)

### Export Features
- [ ] CSS custom properties export
- [ ] Tailwind config export
- [ ] Raw OKLCH values export
- [ ] Generate documentation in Figma (frame with color swatches, hex values, contrast ratios)
- [ ] Generate documentation webpage (HTML export for sharing/reference)

### Figma Variable modes
- [ ] Figma Variable modes support (Light/Dark/Themes/ with different values per mode)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Preset color palettes / templates (neutral gray, warm gray, Material style)
- [ ] Color blindness preview (deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia simulation)
- [ ] Bulk operations (duplicate row, drag-and-drop reorder, multi-delete)
- [ ] P3/Wide gamut support (output P3 colors for modern displays)
- [ ] Custom collection naming (let users name the Figma variable collection)
- [ ] Hue rotation direction (short path vs long path around color wheel)
- [ ] Multi-anchor palettes (define 2-4 anchor colors, interpolate between them)
- [ ] Dark stop protection toggle (like `preserveColorIdentity` but for dark stops - automatically lift lightness when chroma would drop below perceptible threshold)

## Deferred Features

### Import Figma Variables

**Status:** Deferred - needs design work before implementation.

**The Challenge:** Octarine's model (seed color → algorithmic generation) differs from Figma's model (independent color values). Bridging these requires careful design.

**Unresolved Edge Cases:**
- Standalone colors with similar hues (e.g., `ButtonBlue`, `LinkBlue`) - should they be merged into one Octarine color, or kept as separate colors?
- Standalone colors with different hues - how to set a meaningful base color from a single stop?
- Palettes split across Figma organizational groups - need to identify which belong to the same logical palette
- Hue similarity threshold - how similar is "similar enough" to treat as one palette?
- Stop number assignment for colors without a numeric suffix

**Future Considerations:**
- Start with simpler scope (only support clean `Label/StopNumber` format)
- Let user manually assign imported colors to palette slots and stops
- Preview before import with user adjustment — each imported palette becomes one Octarine color in the flat list
- Consider implementing after Figma Variable modes support
